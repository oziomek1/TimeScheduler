# TimeScheduler

*Still in progress*

Android App which helps organise your time

The purpose of this app is *NOT* to plan your day

Here you add your current activities and at the end of a day you can check how much time you have spent on them.

The main feature of this app is the navigation bar which allows you to customize your buttons with your most popular activities so you don't have to open app each time you want to post new activity.
There is also a button which allows you to post your previous activity, interrupted by another one
